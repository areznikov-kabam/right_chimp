INSTALLING FROM GEM
-------------------

This is the easiest way to get up and running with chimp. Make sure you have
Ruby and RubyGems installed. You can then install on your system by using the
following command:

        gem install chimp-<version>.gem

INSTALLING FROM SOURCE
----------------------

If you want to hack on chimp or just run unstable code, then you've come to
the right place! To install chimp from source, first make sure you have 
all the required gems installed. Change to the chimp source directory and
execute:

        bundle install

Chimp uses a rakefile to perform most common operations. For a complete list
of rake targets, please see "rake -T". To build and install the gem:

        rake build
        rake install
